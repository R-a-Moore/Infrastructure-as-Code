## What is Infrastructure as Code?
(Often written as IaC) Infrastructure is where you codify everything, where you code every little thing as code to automate it all.

For example, instead of performing all of the steps to construct a VPC in AWS, you have a script/program which performs it all on your behalf upon the execution of that code, automating the entire process.

IaC models are able to repeatedly construct and deploy networks, load balancers, and machines of the same template. Generating them as many times as need be, by the engineer.

### Benefits

IaC avoids manual configuration to enforce consistency.
